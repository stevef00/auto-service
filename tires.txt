   Alternative Tire Rotation Patterns [#]_

Dismount Tire
-------------

Tools Required
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* valve core tool
* tire machine
* tire tool (spoon?)

Break Bead
~~~~~~~~~~

#. Remove valve core and allow tire to fully deflate.

#. Remove wheel weights.

#. Align shovel of tire machine with outside edge of rim.

#. Ensure that the shovel edge is on the tire sidewall near to but not
   touching rim of wheel. To prevent damage to TPMS sensor place the
   valve stem at the 12 or 6'oclock position.

   .. NOTE::
      Use a rubber cover on tire machine shovel to prevent scratches
      on wheel.

#. With tire correctly aligned with tire machine shovel, press
   appropriate pedal to engage shovel. Press pedal until bead breaks.

#. Release pedal returning shovel to starting position. Check that bead
   is broken along entire outside rim of wheel. If required, rotate
   wheel 180 degrees and repeat step #5.

#. After fully breaking outside bead, flip tire so that the shovel
   is toward the inside edge of the rim.

#. Repeat steps #4-#6 to break inside bead.

Remove Tire from Wheel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Place wheel on tire machine with the outside of the rim facing up.

#. Use appropriate tire machine foot pedal to clamp rim. Steel wheels
   can be clamped on the inside. Special care is needed for aluminum,
   chrome plated, or other decorative wheels. These wheels should be
   clamped on the rim edge:

   a. Use the appropriate tire machine pedal to expand clamps wider
      that the diameter of the wheel.

   #. Rest rim edge against the nearest two clamps.

   #. Use the appropriate pedal to retract clamps until the wheel is
      secure.

   .. NOTE::
      It may be necessary to press down on center of wheel to provide
      access for clamps to grip rim. Use the robo-arm (if equipped)
      to press down on the wheel center. Remove wheel center cap (if
      equipped) before using the robo-arm to press down on the wheel.

#. Align the "duck head" of tire machine with edge of rim.

   .. NOTE::
      If the tire is low-profile or will be remounted, lubricate the
      bead before dismounting.

#. Rotate wheel until valve stem is centered on or slightly behind the
   duck head.

#. Insert tire tool between duck head and tire bead. It may be
   necessary to press down on the tire sidewall to get the tool
   inserted.

#. Press outside end of tire tool down to create leverage on tire
   bead, lifting it above the edge of rim.

#. While pressing down on tire tool, press lightly on appropriate
   tire machine pedal to begin slowly rotating tire. As tire starts
   to rotate, the bead will be pulled above duck head.

#. When tire bead is above duck head, remove tire tool to prevent
   scratching wheel as it rotates.

#. Continue pressing pedal, rotating tire until outer bead is fully
   above edge of rim.

#.  Once outer bead is fully outside of the outer rim, continue to
    rotate wheel until valve stem is at the original starting position.

#.  Place tire tool between duck head and lower (inner) bead of tire.

#.  Press outside end of tire tool down to create leverage on tire
    bead, lifting inner bead of tire over duck head.

#.  While pression down on tire tool, press lightly on appropriate
    tire machine pedal to begin slowly rotating tire. As tire starts
    to rotate, carefully remove tire tool to prevent scratching rim.

#.  Continue pressing pedal, rotating tire until inner bead is fully
    above edge of rim.

#.  Return arm of tire machine to starting position to allow removal
    of tire.

#.  Press tire machine pedal to release rim.

#.  Position the TPMS sensor at the 6'oclock position on tire machine.

#.  Lubricate inner and outer bead of tire.

#.  Set tire on wheel with inner bead of tire in the wheel's drop
    center on the side nearest the duck head.

    .. NOTE::

       Check tire sidewall information for inner/outer or directional
       markings and ensure the tire is oriented correctly on wheel.

#.  Swing duck head in and align with edge of rim.

#.  Place inner bead of tire over wing and under the head of the duck
    head. After inner bead is correctly positioned on duck head, use
    a twisting motion on the tire to create friction between bead and
    duck head.

#.  Press pedal to rotate tire until inner bead of tire is completely
    in the wheel's drop center.

#.  Repeat procedure for outer tire bead. Use bead assist arm (if equipped)
    or left hand to press down on tire as it rotates to keep the bead
    in the wheel's drop center.

#.  Release wheel and lift off of clamps.

    .. WARNING::
       Wheel must not be clamped on rim edge while inflating.

#.  With the valve core removed, connect tire changer's air hose to valve
    stem. Press appropriate pedal to inflate tire and set the beads.

    .. NOTE::
       It may be necessary to lift up on the tire while inflating to set
       the beads.

    .. WARNING::
       Do not exceed 50 psi while inflating tire. If a higher psi is
       required, follow additional safety procedures.

#.  Install valve core and adjust final tire pressure.
