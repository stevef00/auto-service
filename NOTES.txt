TIRE TIP:
REPLACING FEWER THAN FOUR TIRES
USTMA recommends replacing all four tires at the same time for optimal performance. If this is not feasible, and you only replace two, install them on the rear axle. The newer tires will have better grip, particularly on wet roads, which is important to avoid hydroplaning situations. The greater traction capability on the rear axle can better prevent a possible oversteer condition and loss of vehicle stability.
